// The CirclePyramid class represents a pyramid of circles.

// See the image at this link for a picture of one pyramid:
// http://i.imgur.com/0NH6vwW.png
//   
// In the above example the upper left-hand corner
// of the pyramid is at (310, 0)
//
// CirclePyramid has a constructor which is provided for you.
// The constructor takes the x and y coordinates of the upper-left hand corner of the
// pyramid, the number of rows in the pyramid and the diameter of each circle
//
// CirclePyramid has a draw method which will draw the pyramid. That method is started
// for you. Your task is to finish the code of the draw method.
//
// You must use nested loops to draw the rows of circles as shown in the picture.
// There is 1 circle in the first row, 2 circles in the second row, and so on.
// You must use the constants provided for the number of rows and the diameter.
//
// Start the first circle at (startX, startY). That means the upper left-hand corner of the 
// rectangle that surrounds the circle is at (startX, startY).
//
// If a circle's upper left-hand corner is at (x, y), then the circle to the right has
// coordinates of (x + DIAMETER, y) and the circle below it has coordinates of
// (x, y + DIAMETER).
//
// Do not add any space between the circles. That will just happen as you draw in the
// correct locations.
//
// To create a circle, create an ellipse where the width and height are equal.
// To create a circle where the upper left-hand corner of the surrounding rectange
// is at (x, y) and the diameter of the circle is DIAMETER, do this:
//
// Ellipse circle = new Ellipse( x, y, DIAMETER, DIAMETER);
//
// Be sure to fill the circles, not draw them.
//
// The viewer provided instantiates and draws two pyramids.
// Here is an image that will be produced:
