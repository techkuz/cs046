// This is a slightly modified version of the CreditCard class from an earlier problem set.
//
// Modify the class so that it implements the Comparable interface.
// Remember that the Comparable interface has one method, compareTo,
// which "returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as
// this object is less than, equal to, or greater than the
// specified object."
// 
// CreditCards are compared by their balance.
//
// If this CreditCard has a bigger balance than another CreditCard does,
// then return a positive number.
//
// If this CreditCard has a smaller balance than another CreditCard does,
// then return a negative number.
//
// Otherwise, the two must be equal, so return 0.
//
// TODO: Add the code to make this class implement the Comparable interface.
//
// (Don't worry about checking if the parameter is a credit card. Assume it is a credit card.)
