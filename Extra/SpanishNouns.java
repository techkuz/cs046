//In Spanish, nouns that end with "a" are feminine while words that end in "o" are masculine.
//(We will ignore exceptions in this exercise). Feminine nouns are preceded by the article
//"la" while maculine words are preceded by the article "el"
//You are to complete the method fixNoun in the SpanishWord class so
//that it returns the noun preceded by:
//  "la " if the noun ends in "a",
//  "el " if it ends in "o"
//  "? " if it ends in some other letter.

//Examples:
//fixNoun(cara) returns: la cara
//fixNoun(ojo) returns: el ojo
//fixNoun(nariz) returns: ? nariz

//(Notice the space between the la and cara, el and ojo, and ? and nariz)

//Hint: Think about how to get the last character of a String and then think about how
// to compare strings

//If you are a Spanish speaker, please ignore any error in this simplified explanation.
//and just follow the directions to return the required string.
