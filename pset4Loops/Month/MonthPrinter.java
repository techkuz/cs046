//Write a class Month.

//A Month has a constructor that takes the month number as a parameter (1 for January,
//2 for February and so forth):
//   public Month(int monthNumber)
//If monthNumber is not 1 to 12, set it to 1.  (This final case you can think of as
//a kind of safeguard against someone using your Month class incorrectly: even if
//someone passes a bad number to your constructor, it will still make a valid month.
//You will make a separate safeguard in your MonthPrinter class to reject bad user
//inputs, but making your code as resiliant as possible to incorrect usage is good
//practice as a programmer!)

//The Month class has 2 methods:
//   public String getMonthName() Use if / else if /else if ...
//   public int getNumberOfDays() Do NOT use a separate if / else branch for each month. 
//Use Boolean operators (&&, ||, !). You will have an if then else if then else
//For February return 28

//These are implemented for you as stubs

//Now write a class MonthPrinter which will instantiate a Month object, ask the user
//for a month number and print the name of the month and the number or days.

//If the month is 6, the output should look exactly like this:
//June 30

//If the user enters an invalid month number print this error message: 
//"Number must be 1 through 12"
//(We include this even though our Month constructor will gracefully handle improper
//inputs.  Using multiple safeguards against incorrect usage is a good idea!)

//If the user enters a non-integer, give this error message: 
//"Not an integer. Terminating"

//To be considered correct, you must enter the message exactly as specified, so be
//careful with the strings you print.
