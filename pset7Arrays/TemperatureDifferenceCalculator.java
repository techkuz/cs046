//This problem will use the same data as the previous one. This time you are
//to complete the TemperatureDifferenceCalculator. It has two methods:

//public double maxDifference() - Calculates the maximum difference between
//any two consecutive days.

//public double minDifference() - Calculates the minimum difference between
//any two consecutive days

//If Jan 7 temperature is 5 degrees and Jan 8 is -10 degrees, the difference
//between the two temperatures is 15. Not that a temperature drop is simply
//considered a 15 degree change. The difference is always the absolute value.
//Assume that the days are in order in the array, so data[0] is the first day,
//data[1] is the second day, and so on.

//Need help starting this question? In the lesson titled 
//"Starting points: Problem Set Questions", go to the
//problem titled "Problem Set 7 - Question 3" for some tips on 
//how to begin.
