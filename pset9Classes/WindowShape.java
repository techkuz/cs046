//Java Windows makes stained glass windows of one particular shape. The windows are
//rectangular with a semi-circle on top. You are given the beginning of a class
//WindowShape to model a window of that shape. You are to provide two methods
//that can be used to calculate area. That will tell us how much glass we will need.
//Provide an instance method area() that returns the area of the window that called it.
//(we would use this if we already had the WindowShape object and wanted its area)

//Provide a static method area() that takes the width and height of the rectangular part
//of the window and returns the area of the entire window - including the semi-circle
//on top.
//(we would use this method if we didn't have a WindowShape object and did not need
//to create one)

//You are not given these method headers in this exercise. That is part of what you
//need to figure out.

//Use Math.PI

//Here is link to a window with that shape.
